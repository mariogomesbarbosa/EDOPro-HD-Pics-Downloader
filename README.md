This is a modification of the [EDOPro HD Pics Downloader](https://github.com/AlexsanderRST/EDOPro-HD-Pics-Downloader) project with the aim of including the option to download, in addition to the card images, the art images as well. All program development rights are assigned to [Alexander Rosante](https://github.com/AlexsanderRST)

This program automates the process of:
- Access [YGO Cards Database](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/); 
- Choose a card;
- Scroll down to 'Download JPG image' or 'Download Cropped Art Image' option;
- Download it into pics folder.

# How it works?

- Put yours deck files '.ydk' on the 'deck' folder;
- Open the 'YGO-Pic-Downloader.exe' (~10 MB);
    - Or 'YGO-Pic-Downloader.py' (~20 kb) (‚ö†Ô∏è[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame 2.0+](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) required);
- Type the name of the '.ydk' file you want to download;
- Click on 'Cards' to download the entire card image;
- Click on 'Artworks' to download the cropped art image.

The method is simple, a python script gets a list of cards ids in a ydk file and use link manipulation to download card per card directly into the pics folder.

## Tips:
- **The program does NOT update automatically**. Update it may solve some issues;
- The ydks in this repo update automatically. Download the ydks every time it is updated is not necessary;
- When downloading all cards, apparently, the download goes faster if all cards pics were deleted before;
- If the allcards.ydk is not deleted after the download (Use the 'Delete ydk' button): the game may open it at deck edit and severe lagging will occour.
